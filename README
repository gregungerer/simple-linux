Simple-Linux
------------

Simple-linux is a set of scripts for simply and quickly building a runnable
embedded linux system. It is targeted at generating the simplest possible
system that can be run on various architecture and machine QEMU emulations.

Initially is support for generating a non-MMU based ColdFire/M5208EVB
linux image. It runs in QEMU or can be run on real hardware.

This is designed to be as absolutely simple and minimal as possible.
Only the first stage gcc is built (that is all we really need) and
only the busybox package to provide a very basic user space. There are
many fully fledged build systems out there, but this script is designed
to be the absolute simplest possible build. The idea is that it shows
the core requirements (or from scratch if you like) procedure in building
a running system. QEMU provides the perfect means to try out the build.

The build starts by building binutils and a first pass minimal gcc,
then builds uClibc, busybox and finally a kernel. All source packages will
be downloaded if not already present locally. The resulting kernel can be
run using QEMU:

Once you have the installed the simple-linux files locally, run the build
script:

    ./build-m68knommu-flt-linux.sh

and then run the resulting system:

   qemu-system-m68k -nographic -machine mcf5208evb -kernel linux-5.16/vmlinux
